# Canonical model registry for harness.
#
# Each [models.<name>] section defines a human-friendly alias that maps to
# the exact model ID string expected by each agent CLI.  Not every agent
# needs a mapping — only the ones that support that model.
#
# This file is compiled into the harness binary via include_str!() as a
# builtin fallback. A fresh copy is also fetched from GitHub and cached at
# ~/.harness/models.toml (TTL: 24 hours). Project-level harness.toml files
# can add or override entries.
