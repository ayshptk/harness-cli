title: What is harness?
description: A unified CLI to run any coding agent from a single interface
---

**harness** is a unified CLI that runs any of four coding agent CLIs — Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, OpenCode, or Cursor — through a single interface.

It spawns the selected agent as a subprocess, translates its native streaming output into a unified NDJSON event stream, and outputs it to stdout. Write one integration, and it works with any supported agent backend.

## Why harness?

Every coding agent has its own CLI, its own flags, its own output format. If you're building tooling on top of coding agents — orchestration systems, CI pipelines, evaluation harnesses, or custom UIs — you'd normally need to write a separate integration for each one.

Harness solves this by providing:

- **One CLI** — `harness run --agent <name> --prompt "..."` works the same regardless of which agent you pick
- **One event format** — 7 unified event types (SessionStart, TextDelta, Message, ToolStart, ToolEnd, Result, Error) with consistent JSON schemas
- **Model aliases** — `--model sonnet` resolves to the right model ID for whichever agent you're using
- **Process safety** — subprocess management with process groups, graceful shutdown, and stderr capture
