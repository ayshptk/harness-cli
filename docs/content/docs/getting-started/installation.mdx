title: Installation
description: Install harness via curl, cargo, or build from source
---

## Recommended: curl installer

The fastest way to install harness:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://harness.lol/install.sh | sh
```

This downloads the latest prebuilt binary for your platform and installs it to `~/.harness/bin/harness`. You may need to add `~/.harness/bin` to your PATH.

## Via crates.io

If you have Rust installed:

```bash
cargo install harnesscli
```

The crate is published as `harnesscli` but the binary is named `harness`.

## Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ayshptk/harness.git
cd harness
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be at `target/release/harness`.

## Verify installation

```bash
harness --version
```

## Prerequisites

Harness itself has no runtime dependencies, but you need at least one agent CLI installed:

- **Claude Code**: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`
- **Codex**: `npm install -g @openai/codex`
- **OpenCode**: `go install github.com/opencode-ai/opencode@latest`
- **Cursor**: installed via the Cursor IDE

Check which agents are available:

```bash
harness list
```
